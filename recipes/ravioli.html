    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Great homemade Italian ravioli recipe that I have recreated to taste like the ravioli at Maggiano's restaurant. Don't be intimidated by the large list of ingredients, it is well worth it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons dried parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.</li>
    </ol>
